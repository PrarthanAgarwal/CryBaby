1. **Basic Component Styling:** The components are using very basic styling with minimal visual flair. For example, the Card component has basic shadow and border radius, but lacks more sophisticated design elements like gradients, patterns, or advanced animations.

2. **Limited Theme System:** While there is a theme system in place (theme.ts), it's quite basic with just primary colors and some basic design tokens. It lacks:
   - Rich color palettes
   - Complex color combinations
   - Advanced typography system
   - Animation presets
   - Complex component variants

3. **Missing Modern UI Elements:** The app could benefit from:
   - Micro-interactions and animations
   - More sophisticated input components
   - Better visual hierarchy
   - Custom illustrations or icons
   - Rich gradients and overlays
   - Advanced card designs with more visual interest

4. **Basic Layout Structure:** The layouts appear to be fairly straightforward without much visual interest or dynamic composition.

To improve the app's appearance, I would recommend:
- **Enhance the design system with:**
   - Richer color palettes and gradients
   - More sophisticated typography scale
   - Advanced shadow system
   - Animation presets
   - Better component variants

- **Add modern UI elements:**
   - Animated transitions between screens
   - Gesture-based interactions
   - Custom illustrations for empty states
   - More sophisticated input controls
   - Better visual feedback for user actions

- **Improve component styling:**
   - Add gradient overlays
   - Implement more sophisticated card designs
   - Use modern design patterns like glassmorphism or neumorphism
   - Add micro-animations for interactions
   
- **Enhance the overall visual hierarchy:**
   - Better spacing system
   - More sophisticated layouts
   - Better use of typography to create visual interest
   - Custom illustrations or icons
