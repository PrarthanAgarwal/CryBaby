Okay, the user wants to set up Google authentication in their Expo and React Native app using Supabase. Let me think through the steps they need to take.

First, they'll need to set up a Supabase project. That means creating an account if they haven't already, making a new project, and enabling Google authentication in the Supabase dashboard. I should mention enabling the provider and adding the OAuth client ID and secret there.

Next, they need to install the necessary packages. Supabase has a JS library, so installing @supabase/supabase-js is essential. Also, since they're using Expo, they'll need expo-auth-session and expo-web-browser for handling the OAuth flow. Maybe expo-crypto for generating a code verifier? Wait, in Expo, the PKCE flow is handled automatically, but maybe they need to generate a code challenge. Or does the auth session library take care of that? I should check. Oh right, using makeRedirectUri and startAsync from expo-auth-session can manage the redirect and the PKCE parameters. So installing those packages is necessary.

Then, initializing the Supabase client. They need to use their Supabase URL and anon key. Important to remind them to keep these secure, maybe using environment variables with Expo Constants or a .env file, though Expo doesn't support .env out of the box without extra configuration.

Setting up the Google OAuth app in the Google Cloud Console. They need to create a project there, enable the Google+ API, create OAuth credentials, and set the redirect URI. The redirect URI for Expo might be their custom scheme, like myapp://auth-redirect, which they can get using expo-auth-session's makeRedirectUri. They have to add this URI to both Google's authorized redirect URIs and Supabase's allowed redirect URLs.

Now, coding the sign-in function. Using AuthSession.startAsync with the Google provider URL from Supabase. Constructing the authorization URL with the client ID, redirect URI, response type, and scopes. Also, including the code challenge and method for PKCE. Then, after the user authenticates, exchanging the code for a session using supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession. Storing the access token and refresh token.

Handling the sign-out is straightforward with supabase.auth.signOut().

Testing the setup. They need to make sure the redirect URIs are correctly configured, run the app on a device or emulator, and check for any errors. Common issues might be mismatched redirect URIs or missing scopes.

Also, maybe mention that on iOS, they need to configure the Info.plist with the custom URL scheme, and on Android, the intent filter in AndroidManifest.xml. Expo might handle some of this automatically, but it's good to check.

Wait, but in Expo, when using the redirect, the makeRedirectUri function should generate the correct URI based on the platform. So in the Google Cloud Console, they need to add the generated redirect URI for both platforms. For example, if the app is named 'myapp', the redirect URI would be something like myapp://auth-redirect. So that needs to be added to the authorized redirect URIs in Google and the allowed redirect URLs in Supabase.

Another thing: when creating the OAuth client in Google, they should select 'Android' as the application type if they're testing on Android, and provide the package name and SHA-1 fingerprint. For iOS, it's the bundle identifier. But since Expo uses a different bundle identifier in development, maybe they need to use the expo.go application if testing in Expo Go. However, if they're building a standalone app, they need to use their own bundle ID. This could get a bit complicated, so maybe suggest using the Expo application for initial testing and then configuring properly for production.

Also, in Supabase, under Authentication -> Providers -> Google, they need to enable the provider and input the client ID and secret obtained from Google Cloud. Make sure those are correct.

In the code example, the signInWithGoogle function uses AuthSession.startAsync to open the Google auth page. Then, if there's no error and the type is 'success', it exchanges the code for a session. They need to handle cases where the user cancels the authentication or there's an error.

Testing in Expo Go might have issues with custom URI schemes. They might need to build a development client or use a third-party authentication flow. Alternatively, using Expo's proxy to handle the redirect during development. But I think expo-auth-session handles this with the proxy redirect URI. Wait, when using the redirect URI from makeRedirectUri, in Expo Go it might default to using the expo.io proxy. So maybe in development, the redirect URI is something like https://auth.expo.io/@username/your-app-slug, which they need to add to Google's authorized redirect URIs and Supabase's allowed redirect URLs. That's an important point. So in development, they have to use the Expo proxy URL, but in production, use their app's custom scheme. They need to handle both environments.

So the steps would be:

1. Create Supabase project and enable Google auth with client ID and secret.

2. Set up OAuth credentials in Google Cloud, adding both the Expo proxy URL (for development) and the custom app scheme (for production) as redirect URIs.

3. Install necessary Expo packages.

4. Initialize Supabase client with environment variables.

5. Implement the sign-in function using expo-auth-session to handle the OAuth flow, including PKCE.

6. Handle the redirect in the app, exchanging the auth code for a session.

7. Test in development using the Expo proxy URL, and ensure production settings are correct.

Also, mention that in Supabase dashboard, under Authentication -> Redirect URLs, they need to add the Expo proxy URL and the custom app scheme.

This should cover the main steps. Now, structure this into a clear guide with code examples and configuration steps.

Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up Google Authentication with Supabase in your Expo React Native app:
1. Set Up Supabase Project

    Create a Supabase account and project at supabase.com

    Go to Authentication > Providers in your Supabase dashboard

    Enable Google provider

    Note your Supabase URL and anon key from Settings > API

2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy

npx expo install @supabase/supabase-js expo-auth-session expo-web-browser expo-crypto

3. Configure Google OAuth

    Go to Google Cloud Console

    Create a new project

    Enable Google+ API under APIs & Services

    Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Web application type)

    Add authorized redirect URIs:

        Development: https://auth.expo.io/@your-username/your-app-slug

        Production: your.app.bundle.id://auth-redirect

    Get Client ID and Client Secret

4. Initialize Supabase Client

Create lib/supabase.ts:
typescript
Copy

import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabaseUrl = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!;
const supabaseKey = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!;

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);

5. Create Auth Component

Create app/auth.tsx:
typescript
Copy

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Button, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import * as AuthSession from 'expo-auth-session';
import * as WebBrowser from 'expo-web-browser';
import { supabase } from '../lib/supabase';

WebBrowser.maybeCompleteAuthSession();

const Auth = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const { data: { subscription } } = supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((event, session) => {
      setUser(session?.user ?? null);
    });

    return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
  }, []);

  const signInWithGoogle = async () => {
    const redirectUrl = AuthSession.makeRedirectUri({
      path: 'auth-redirect',
      useProxy: true,
    });

    const response = await AuthSession.startAsync({
      authUrl: `${process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL}/auth/v1/authorize?` + new URLSearchParams({
        provider: 'google',
        redirect_to: redirectUrl,
      }).toString(),
      returnUrl: redirectUrl,
    });

    if (response.type === 'success') {
      const { access_token, refresh_token } = response.params;
      if (access_token && refresh_token) {
        await supabase.auth.setSession({
          access_token,
          refresh_token,
        });
      }
    }
  };

  const signOut = async () => {
    await supabase.auth.signOut();
  };

  return (
    <View>
      {user ? (
        <>
          <Text>Welcome {user.email}</Text>
          <Button title="Sign Out" onPress={signOut} />
        </>
      ) : (
        <Button title="Sign in with Google" onPress={signInWithGoogle} />
      )}
    </View>
  );
};

export default Auth;

6. Configure Environment Variables

In your .env file:
env
Copy

EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

7. Update Supabase Redirect URLs

In Supabase dashboard:

    Go to Authentication > URL Configuration

    Add redirect URLs:

        Development: https://auth.expo.io/@your-username/your-app-slug/*

        Production: your.app.bundle.id://auth-redirect

8. Configure Deep Linking (for Production)

Add to app.json:
json
Copy

{
  "expo": {
    "scheme": "your.app.bundle.id",
    "android": {
      "intentFilters": [{
        "action": "VIEW",
        "data": [{
          "scheme": "your.app.bundle.id"
        }],
        "category": ["BROWSABLE", "DEFAULT"]
      }]
    },
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "your.app.bundle.id"
    }
  }
}

9. Testing

    Run your app with npx expo start

    Use a physical device or emulator (web browsers won't work for OAuth)

    Handle common errors:

        Redirect URI mismatch: Verify all redirect URLs match exactly

        Invalid OAuth credentials: Double-check Google Client ID/Secret

Additional Considerations

    For production, consider using a development build or EAS Build

    Add error handling for failed authentication attempts

    Implement secure storage for tokens using expo-secure-store

    Add loading states during authentication

    Handle token refresh logic

This setup uses the PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) flow for secure authentication. The Expo proxy helps during development, while the custom scheme handles production authentication.
